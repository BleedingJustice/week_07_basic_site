        <p>Just a Metal-head from a small town in Idaho</p>
<p>
My love for Metallica started back in 1983, when my Cousin Mike Cameron (R.I.P.), brought back Kill 'Em All from Germany. 
When I first plugged in the tape, I was WTF! Is this? I really dug the very fast paced music and lyrics, even though it took me a week to 
totally understand what Hetfield were singing. Then I was hooked. You got to figure at this time this was the heaviest stuff around, 
except some Sabbath, Van Halen, Styx and such. Since then, my neighbors have heard plenty of MetallicA coming through my veins, I mean 
speakers. Back around 1998 I had a co-worker call me over the intercom “Metal-EdicA come to isle 16”? That has stuck since then, and I 
use that and CreepingMaster as my screen names. I first saw MetallicA live near my BDay in 1992, what a present to myself, even though it 
just about did not happen (long Story). In Idaho didn’t announce concerts in Utah until the ..And Justice For All tour, but I have had 
the opportunity to see them 14 times. My favorite concert was the Lallapalooza in 1986 at the Firebird Raceway in Phoenix, Arizona. When 
you have a few minutes, a lot happened at this concert. But, the best parts was that when MetallicA hit the stage, there was still a 
twister earlier and in the background of the open stage and there was lightening from the twister, Hetfield came on and said, we are not 
going to let a damn twister stop our show.
